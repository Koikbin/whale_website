The idea of eduroam was first proposed in 2003, tested by institutes over five  countries in Europe.  Educational institutes and NRENs in other European countries joined this infrastructure one by one later on.  This service was then named ""eduroam"", which means ""Education Roaming"". Now eduroam has become a mature service for  international Wi-Fi roaming, NTU established its own Service Set Identifier (SSID) for eduroam. The guidance is as  follows:  SSID Authentication Mechanism account notes  NTU Authentication Website XXXXX@ntu.edu.tw The same account as NTU-ID(provided by C&INC) ntu_peap 802.1X, PEAP XXXXX@ntu.edu.tw The same account as NTU-ID(provided by C&INC) eduroam 802.1X, PEAP XXXXX@eduroam.ntu.edu.tw For international and domestic interuniversity roaming Applying for an NTU eduroam:NTU eduroam According to eduroam , the use of 802.1x for authentication.  Besides, a web portal for authentication is not used by eduroam, for it is not secure. Be aware that any webpage  asking your username or password might be a sign of a hijack.
