Each IP have 6GB for dorm network every day. Network flows between dorms' networks and out-of-NTU networks are counted in the quota, and network flows among dorms or NTU departments are not  counted. Windows update, Mac update and other online meeting applications provided by C&INC are not counted. Network speed would cut to 30 Mbps / 25Mbps (download / upload) for an IP with used-up network flow above 6GB a day. Network speed would cut to 5 Mbps / 2 Mbps (download / upload) for an IP with used-up network flow above 10GB a day. Network flows quota is reset at 8am each day. Network flows quota can be checked at quota checked page (need to use IP on campus). Reference for quota checking page: Network   flows quota check.

In the administrative  system of the University, the Student Housing Services Division of the Office of Student Affairs was responsible for  installing and managing the networks at students’ dorms. The C&INC only played the role of an assistant,  offering necessary help when help was needed. Nevertheless, the Networking Management Division of C&INC took the  initiative to improve the quality of networks at students’ dorms and regarded it as its key task. 　　As of now, C&INC has invested large amounts of money and manpower on improving the quality of networking in  the students’ dorms. We hope that all students can comply with the rules and regulations of network use, so we can  upgrade the networks both in quality and quantity. At present we have server rooms installed in the Chang-hsing  Street dorms (Men’s 1st, 3rd, 5tgh, 6th, 7th, & 8th), the main campus dorms (women’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 8th,  and 9th, freshmen women’s 1st, graduate students 1st, men’s 13rd, graduate students 3rd, math and chemistry dorm);  College of Medicine dorms ( men’s 2nd, women’s 6th), College of Law dorms (men’s 4th, men’s 16th, women’s 4th  and women’s 7th). Of all these dorms, with the exception of the ones that belong to College of Medicine and College  of Law, which use 1 Gbps bandwidth to connect to C&INC, all the other dorms use 10 Gbps to connect to us. For  all students who live in the dorms, their bandwidth for internet use is 100 Mbps. So far their condition of use is  very good. Aspects of Dormitory Networks Management MAC control, IP control, configuration control, abnormality control, the browser of blocked user redirect  function, flow rate analysis, and flow rate management. In the future the dormitory network system will be equipped with DHCP servers, with back-up functions and the  capability to directly control the giving out and retention of IP addresses. The unregistered IP addresses are limited to only a handful of special websites or sub-networks within the  University.  Every IP addresses is allotted a different flow quota in accordance with the owner’s Identity, authorization, and  use. Every IP addresses is allotted a different flow quota in accordance with the owner’s Identity, authorization,  and use.   Copyright (c) 2019 National Taiwan University All Rights Reserved.
